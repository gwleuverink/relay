## Features

Relay comes packed with powerful features to enhance your GitHub Workflows experience:

- **Notifications**: Get instant alerts when new runs are detected
- **Live Status Updates**: Watch your workflows progress in real-time
- **Detailed Insights**: Dive deep into workflow runs with comprehensive execution details
- **Workflow Control**: Trigger, cancel, and manage workflow runs directly from your menu bar

## Coming soon

- Live workflow log streaming
- Advanced notification configuration
- Raspberry Pi client support (make your own external e-ink monitor)

## Getting started

At present, only a macOS build is available. Windows and Linux builds are pending due to lack of testing environments. Contributions from users with access to these platforms are more than welcome.

## Supporting the Project

To distribute Phost on macOS, the application needs to be signed and notarized through the Apple Developer Program, which costs â‚¬100 annually. If you find Relay useful, please consider supporting its development and maintenance through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/gwleuverink). Your support helps cover these costs and enables continued development of this open-source tool.
