# Relay

## About

## Getting started

At present, only a macOS build is available. Windows and Linux builds are pending due to lack of testing environments. Contributions from users with access to these platforms are more than welcome.

[Download the latest release here](https://github.com/gwleuverink/git-relay/releases).

## Supporting the Project

To distribute Phost on macOS, the application needs to be signed and notarized through the Apple Developer Program, which costs â‚¬100 annually. If you find Relay useful, please consider supporting its development and maintenance through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/gwleuverink). Your support helps cover these costs and enables continued development of this open-source tool.
