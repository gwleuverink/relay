## Supporting the Project

To distribute Relay on macOS, the application needs to be signed and notarized through the Apple Developer Program, which costs â‚¬100 annually. If you find Relay useful, please consider supporting its development and maintenance through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/gwleuverink). Your support helps cover these costs and enables continued development of this open-source tool.
